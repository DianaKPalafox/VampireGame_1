# VampireGame_1 

## Project Description 
This is a simple game made with python using pygames along with py2app to be executable on mac and windows. It currently only works on Mac. Its objective is just to shoot the balls with the cross bow and to not die as you only have one life. Some of the challenges I faced is making it work with the windows platform. My goal is to make it usable for the windows platform. I hope to incopperate some AI and new levels in this game.
